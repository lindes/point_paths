point_paths
===========

point_paths is a [processing](http://www.processing.org/) "sketch"
(program) for exploring the paths of points in and around the
[Mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

Written by [David Lindes](https://github.com/lindes) with the intent
of increasing understanding of the way the Mandelbrot set is computed,
it was demonstrated at
[Berlin Hack & Tell #18](http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Hack-and-Tell/events/100995462/),
where it won the audience vote for "best hack of the month".  That
presentation can be seen here:
